# HackathonDFW
Project for the 2019 DFWHackathon
Developers: Eddie Gonzalez and Jacob Siau

Project Idea: Time Entry System that is controlled via Amazon Alexa. 

Example Scenario: 
Employee: "Alexa, clock me in"
Alexa: "Okay, who is this?"
Employee: "Eddie Gonzalez"
Alexa: "Verify PIN"
Employee: "1234"
Alexa: "You are now clocked in, Eddie"

The front-end acts as a display screen only. There is no interaction between the front-end and the user.

The backend is supposed to recieve information from Alexa, but no progress was made to complete this.

In order to change an employee's status to "clocked in", "clocked out", or "on break", 
you must send data to the backend via Postman. The status updates on the front-end in real-time with no refresh needed.
